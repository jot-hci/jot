Project 5
---------

**Component #1 Data Collection Form: Sign-up Page**<br /> 

1. **Task**:<br /> 
A brief description of the task scenario you chose to implement for P5.

2. **Component**:<br /> 
A brief description of the component you chose to implement for P5.

3. **Link**:<br />
Create a branch in your team’s repository called project_5 and push all the code you want your peer mentor to assess for this submission to that branch. It’s fine to have additional working branches in your repository as long as your project_5 branch is not edited after the submission deadline. Then submit a link to your team’s project_5 branch. In addition, if you have a working demo online (highly recommended), submit a link to that as well.

4. **Platform**:<br />
The platform we should use to view your prototype (for example, Chrome on Windows).

5. **Design Summary**:<br />
Write one paragraph about how your prototype for this task scenario and component applies Norman’s user interface design principles, and one paragraph about how your prototype applies the graphic design principles covered in class (you should have exactly two paragraphs, no more, no less). You do not have to mention all of the principles, just tell us how you were thinking about and applying some these principles as you were working on your prototype.
