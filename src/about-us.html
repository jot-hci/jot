                    <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
                    <p>
                        According to the 2019 State of Mental Health in America report,
                        over 44 million American adults have a mental illness. Though
                        therapy can help the mentally ill improve their well-being, one
                        of the biggest obstacles in therapy is tracking mental health progress.
                        According to Psychology Today, patients should introspect between sessions
                        for best results. Furthermore, one of the best ways to do this is for patients
                        to articulate their thoughts through journaling. However, patients often
                        forego this technique, resulting in less effective treatment and an inability
                        to track progress. That's where Jot comes in: our platform offers a space
                        for patients to journal about their therapy experiences. This way, users can
                        highlight important principles discussed with their therapist, track their
                        progress quantitatively, and maintain frequent communcation with their mental
                        health professional.
