                    <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
                    <p>
                        According to the 2019 State of Mental Health in America report, 
                        over 44 million American adults have a mental illness. Though 
                        therapy can help the mentally ill improve their well-being, one 
                        of the biggest obstacles in therapy is tracking mental health progress. 
                        According to Psychology Today, patients should introspect between sessions 
                        for best results. Furthermore, one of the best ways to do this is for patients 
                        to articulate their thoughts through journaling. However, patients often 
                        forego this technique, resulting in less effective treatment and an inability 
                        to track progress. That's where Jot comes in: our platform offers a space 
                        for patients to journal about their therapy experiences. This way, users can 
                        highlight important principles discussed with their therapist, track their 
                        progress quantitatively, and maintain frequent communcation with their mental 
                        health professional.
